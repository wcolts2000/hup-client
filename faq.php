              minimum order?</div>
            <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Depending on what type of garment service you get the minimums will
                vary. If you are looking for silk screen printing,
                the minimum order will be a dozen (12) garments per design. Bulk pricing breaks decrease the price per
                unit as the order number increases on silk screen jobs.
                Color changes are allowed on the same design but do add an additional fee. With Embroidery, you can get
                an number of garments or accessories embroidered.
                Digitizing fees for the artwork may apply. With vinyl presses you may get as may as you like as well,
                but no bulk pricing will apply.</span></div>

            <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Depending on the garment, most areas are able to be printed or
                embroidered on, but each location is charged accordingly.

            <div class="collapsible-body"><span>With silk screen prints, there is a $15.00 color change fee on each

            <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Large format, or wide format, printing is handled on printers between
                18" and 100" in width.
                When getting larger than 100" it becomes referred to as super wide or grand format printing. It is
                commonly done with solvent
                inks, eco-solvent inks, or dye-sublimation on a large variety of substrates from banner material,
                canvas, adhesive vinyls,
                perforated window vision, wallpaper, vehicle wrap, and more. The Prints can be used indoors and outdoors

            <div class="collapsible-body"><span>“Eco-solvent” inks are made with ether extracts from refined mineral
                oils and have a
                low VOC content. Eco-solvent inks allow for indoor printing without the need for ventilation systems
                needed with traditional solvent inks.

                A dynamic site is pulling data or information from an outside source or database and is affected by user
                interactions. If your site has a login system or
                an e-commerce type site with shopping carts, etc. it is a dynamic site.
