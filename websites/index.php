          <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons teal-text">arrow_drop_down_circle</i>Do I need to
            know anything about coding to have a website?</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Absolutely not. Any level of experience will do. If you can log into
              your email and navigate a basic website, we can set
              you up to be able to add anything you want to your site once we build it depending on how much you want
              to be able to modify it.</span></div>

          <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons teal-text">arrow_drop_down_circle</i>What about
            free services like wix?</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body"><span>While there are free services out there to quickly get a basic site
              started, these free platforms give very limited customization
              and personalization abilities. That being said, if you just don't have the time to learn them yourself
              or are intimidated by the prospect of doing it, our professional
              developers can help get you going. Check our pricing to find your fit.

          <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons teal-text">arrow_drop_down_circle</i>What's the
            difference between a static and a dynamic site?</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body"><span>A static site has information that does change or infrequently changes
              and does not change based on the users actions.
              A dynamic site is pulling data or information from an outside source or database and is affected by user
              interactions. If your site has a login system or
              an e-commerce type site with shopping carts, etc. it is a dynamic site.

            when I need changes?</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body"><span>That depends on how the site is created. If you have a site created by
              us with a CMS (Content Management System) being utilized,
              there will be easy options for you to add new info or modify existing info on your site. If you prefer a
              hands off approach, we have packages available.

          <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons teal-text">arrow_drop_down_circle</i>Can you get me
            ranking on Google?</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body"><span>SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is a timely and extensive process
              that depends on numerous factors. Rankings depend on the
              industry and key terms you are trying to get noticed with. There are packages available, but do note
              that it is not an overnight thing. Rankings can take up to 6
              months or more depending on the competition.

              start fresh and get you something brand new,
              centered around customer conversions.
